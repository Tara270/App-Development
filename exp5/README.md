When you start an Expo project using the command:

What Does the .expo Folder Contain?

The .expo folder stores local configuration and session information for your project. The key files include:

devices.json
Contains information about devices that have recently opened this project.
Used to populate the Development sessions list in your development builds.

packager-info.json
Stores port numbers and process IDs (PIDs) used to serve the app to your mobile device or simulator.

settings.json
Contains server configuration used to serve the application manifest.

Should You Commit the .expo Folder?

No. You should not commit or share the .expo folder.

It contains machine-specific information that is not relevant to other developers.

Expo automatically adds .expo to your .gitignore file to prevent it from being included in version control.
